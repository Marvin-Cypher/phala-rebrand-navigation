# Landing Page Copy Review & Recommendations

## Current Hero Copy Analysis

### Current:
```
"A Decentralized Cloud"
"By the people, for the people"
"CRYPTOGRAPHIC"
"Not Tomorrow. Today."
"Eliminate centralized trust from Web3.
No months of work. No 1000x performance penalty."
```

### Issues for AI Builders:
- "Decentralized" immediately signals crypto/Web3
- "By the people, for the people" - too ideological, not practical
- "CRYPTOGRAPHIC" - technical jargon that scares non-crypto users
- "Eliminate centralized trust from Web3" - explicitly Web3 focused

## Recommended Hero Copy Options

### Option A: Direct & Clear
```
Headline: "Secure AI Compute That Just Works"
Subheadline: "Deploy AI models with confidence"
Tag: "ENTERPRISE-READY"
Promise: "Not Tomorrow. Today."
Description: "Hardware-level protection for your AI workloads.
No complexity. No compromises. Just secure infrastructure."
```

### Option B: Performance Focused
```
Headline: "GPU-Powered Secure AI"
Subheadline: "Where speed meets security"
Tag: "95% BARE METAL PERFORMANCE"
Promise: "Deploy in Minutes, Not Months"
Description: "Run AI models on NVIDIA H100s with TEE protection.
Full performance. Full privacy. Full control."
```

### Option C: Trust-First (Building on Sales Book)
```
Headline: "The Trust Layer for Enterprise AI"
Subheadline: "Build AI your customers actually trust"
Tag: "ZERO-TRUST INFRASTRUCTURE"
Promise: "Ship Today. Sleep Tonight."
Description: "Turn privacy concerns into competitive advantage.
Verifiable security. Auditable by design. Open source."
```

## Stats Section Review

### Current:
- "30,335 TEE Nodes Online"
- "67,945,313 Secured Value In PHA-backed cryptographic computation"

### Recommended Updates:

**Option 1: AI-Focused Metrics**
- "30,335+ Secure GPUs Available"
- "67M+ AI Inferences Protected Daily"

**Option 2: Business Metrics**
- "30,335+ Enterprise Workloads"
- "$67M+ Customer Data Secured"

**Option 3: Performance Metrics**
- "30,335+ Active Compute Nodes"
- "67M+ Models Deployed Securely"

## Key Principles for Copy Updates

### DO:
- Lead with practical benefits (speed, security, simplicity)
- Use familiar cloud/AI terminology
- Focus on outcomes (deploy models, protect data)
- Emphasize compatibility (Docker, PyTorch, TensorFlow)

### DON'T:
- Use crypto/blockchain terminology
- Lead with technical implementation (TEE, cryptographic)
- Focus on ideology (decentralization, trustless)
- Assume knowledge of Web3 concepts

## Tagline Evolution

### Current: "By the people, for the people"
### Options:
1. "By developers, for developers"
2. "Security without complexity"
3. "Your AI, your data, our protection"
4. "Deploy with confidence"
5. "Where AI meets uncompromising security"

## CTA Button Copy

### Current: Not visible in design
### Recommendations:
- Primary: "Start Free Trial"
- Secondary: "See It In Action"
- Tertiary: "View Documentation"

## Trust Indicators to Add

Below hero section:
- "SOC 2 Certified"
- "HIPAA Compliant"
- "99.9% Uptime SLA"
- "Open Source"

## The Winner (My Recommendation)

**Hero Copy:**
```
"Secure AI Compute That Just Works"
"Deploy AI models with hardware-level protection"

[Green Tag] PRODUCTION READY

"Not Tomorrow. Today."

"Run your AI workloads on GPU TEEs with 95% bare metal performance.
No blockchain knowledge required. No complex setup. Just secure infrastructure."

[CTA: Start Free Trial] [CTA: Book Demo]
```

**Why This Works:**
1. Clear value prop for AI builders
2. Addresses performance concerns upfront
3. Explicitly says "no blockchain knowledge required"
4. Maintains your "Today" urgency
5. Technical enough to be credible, simple enough to understand
