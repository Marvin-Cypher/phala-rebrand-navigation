## Immediate Impact Measurement

### Analytics to Track
- Bounce rate from organic "AI compute" searches
- Time on page for new visitors
- Conversion rate to free trial
- Feedback from AI-focused visitors

### Success Indicators (Week 1)
- 20% reduction in bounce rate
- 30% increase in trial signups from AI keywords
