# Phala Network Rebrand Strategy

## Executive Summary
Transform Phala from a "Web3 infrastructure" company to the "Secure AI Compute Platform" - focusing on privacy, performance, and developer experience for AI builders.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Current Positioning
1. **Immediate Crypto Signal**: Homepage leads with "Eliminate centralized trust from Web3"
2. **Technical Jargon Overload**: TEE, MPC, ZKP, trustless, decentralized - too much too fast
3. **Wrong Visual Language**: Typical Web3 aesthetics with blockchain partner logos
4. **Buried Value Prop**: AI benefits hidden behind crypto terminology
5. **Complex Onboarding**: Requires understanding blockchain concepts

### What AI Builders Actually Care About
- **Performance**: Fast GPU/CPU access for training and inference
- **Cost**: Competitive pricing vs AWS/GCP
- **Developer Experience**: Simple deployment, familiar tools
- **Security**: Data privacy without complexity
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA ready
- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ uptime

## New Brand Positioning

### Core Positioning Statement
"Phala Cloud is the secure compute platform that lets AI teams deploy with confidence - protecting sensitive data while maintaining peak performance."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Privacy by Default**: TEE technology simplified for AI use cases
2. **No Vendor Lock-in**: Open platform vs AWS Nitro's proprietary approach
3. **Compliance Ready**: Built-in GDPR/HIPAA compliance features
4. **Developer First**: Deploy with Docker, integrate with existing ML pipelines
5. **Cost Effective**: 30-50% cheaper than traditional secure compute

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Primary Message (Hero)
"Secure AI Compute Without Compromise"

### Supporting Messages
